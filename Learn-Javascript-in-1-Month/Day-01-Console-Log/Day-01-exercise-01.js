// Instructions
// Write a computer program to console log Hello, world! in to the Output area.

// IMPORTANT: Make sure your output matches the Expected Output exactly, including punctuation.

// Expected Output
// Hello, world!
// Use the RUN CODE button to see your code work. Once you're happy with your code, use the SUBMIT button to test your code and see if it is correct. The RESET button will reset your code to the original starting code (in this case the starting code is a blank file).

// Hint 1
// Remember the action code is console.log()
// And the thing code is "thing"

console.log("Hello, world!");

// console.log() is the action code that outputs to the console.
// Hello, world! is the thing code that you want to output.
// "Hello, world!" is a string, which is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
